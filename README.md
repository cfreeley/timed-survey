# Timed Survey

Built for a Psychology experiment I'm running to test the effects of slower text intake on test performance. Built using Bootstrap and Handlebars, the three questions are the standard CRT (cognitive reflection test) questions.

Allows you to add a "typewriter" effect to a simple survey.
